      * Christianity sapped the vitality of the Roman empire, it is responsible for Roman empire traditions dying down
      * Christianity replaces old Pagan belief systems in Rome
      * Christianity sees massive expansion from coastal areas (lots of people here) to more centralized areas
      * The conversion of people who had been marginalized, the lower classes of society and women
